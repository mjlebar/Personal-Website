          This is a slightly more complex project - I put this one together with
          webpack. Took some effort to figure out how to get that to work with
          github but mission accomplished! Allows for adding and editing todos
          or projects, and stores everything local storage (though I am not sure
          that aspect works with GitHub).

          This was a tic-tac-toe game I developed in JavaScript. Right now you
          can play against another player (or yourself). I'm planning to come
          back and add a CPU at some point!

          A fairly simple but fun JavaScript project - an etch-a-sketch that
          allows you to recreate the grid in any size you'd like.

          A calculator also developed in JavaScript. The main functionality
          isn't super complicated, but there are a decent number of possible
          cases you have to look out for (what if operations are chained? what
          if the number is too long for the calculator? Etc.). Check out the
          codebase if you want to see how I handled them.
