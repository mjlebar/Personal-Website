        Hi! My name is Matthew LeBar, and I am a former math major and math
        educator looking to use my skills to begin a career as a software
        developer. I've been working the past few months to learn Python
        (including PyTorch, NumPy, and Pandas), JavaScript (especially React,
        which is what I built this site in), Java, SQL, CSS, and HTML. In that
        process, I've found that the skills I trained in math - rapidly
        developing deep conceptual understanding, creative problem-solving, and
        precisely articulating technical concepts - have been invaluable. My
        background in math gives me the tools I need to feel confident
        understanding code, and to use that understanding to solve problems.
        I've learned a lot already but I'm excited to continue to deepen my
        knowledge - I would love to bring my passion for learning to your
        company!
      </p>
