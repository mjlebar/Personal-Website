        Hi! My name is Matthew LeBar, and I am a Master's Student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where I am focusing on Machine Learning and Data Analytics, as well as training my computer science fundamentals. Before I started at UChicago, I spent some time learning software development skills on my own. This website provides a directory of some of the projects I'm most proud of from that time, including a machine learning project ("Spirit GPT") I developed by following an online tutorial, as well as several JavaScript projects I worked on through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">The Odin Project</a>.
